Hi, I am a front-end developer who worked at Google for two years from 2021 to 2023. I have helped the team solve many problems and learned a lot. Currently, I think there is a lot of room for development in web3. This account is used to record some projects related to web3. We welcome web3 enthusiasts to communicate with us
